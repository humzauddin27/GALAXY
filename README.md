# GALAXY
Python game. Use the arrow keys and space bar to avoid and defeat your enemies! Try to win before you lose all your lives!
Currently intending on changing how the lasers work so that they don't glitch out and get stuck on the screen. Other ideas include making the mouse a usable input (potentially mouse moves ship, WASD keys to rotate ship or something of the like). Also, maybe include asteroid dodging.
